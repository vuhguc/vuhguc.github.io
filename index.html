            <p>This is my current co-op rotation. I have worked here part-time since August 2019 and registered as a co-op rotation in Fall 2020. iCDCU is a research lab found by Dr. Danny Wu focusing on applications of information technologies in biomedical fields. I have worked on many different projects here; the most recent one was using Elasticsearch and Learning to Rank to retrieve medical text. I have learned many new concepts and technologies in Natural Language Processing, most notably Python libraries NLTK and scikit-learn. One non-technical concept I have learned is working in an agile style (dividing a project into small development stages).</p>

            <p>This was my first co-op rotation. My main project there was developing a cyber-security wargame in C. The game included a monitor that worked as a server; players were clients connecting to the server and playing the game according to a set of rules. I developed the monitor in C and a simple client user interface in Java Swing. The most important technical concepts I learned were multithreading and socket programming in C. I also learned how to read and learn new concepts from research paper.</p>

    <div class="resume-item d-flex flex-column flex-md-row mb-5">
      <div class="resume-content mr-auto">
        <p>I had prior experiences with programming and algorithms in high school; that was why I chose to major in Computer Science. My main goal in college was to explore career opportunities in Computer Science, so I chose University of Cincinnati for its co-op program. That was indeed the right choice; I learned a lot about the real life application of Computer Science from my co-op experiences. In my first co-op, I learned how a real cyber-security system is designed. In my second co-op, I learned how programming is applied in other fields like biomedical sciences. Moreover, I learned many soft skills like how to work in a team, how to design a practical product, and how to manage the development phases. I would not have known these things without my co-op experiences.</p>
        <p>When I first entered college, I decided that I would try working in both academic environment (research lab) and industrial environment (software engineer intern for companies). My plan was finding research work in my earlier co-op rotations and finding industrial work in later rotations. However, the COVID pandemic happened; it was much more difficult to find an internship, so I had to stick to research work this semester (and probably next semester). That was somewhat frustrating. If I were starting over again, I would try to find industrial co-ops in my first rotations. However, I appreciate my chances as I learned a lot in the academic environment, and I really liked this kind of work. I still want to try working in the industrial environment, so my main goal for the remaining co-op experiences is to find software engineer intern positions at big tech companies.</p>
